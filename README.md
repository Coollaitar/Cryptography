# Cryptography

## Blockchain Cryptograhy Docuementation

## Blockchains

Purpose of Blockchain :

- No person or organization can control a particular process

Why Blockchain? :

- Blockchain was invented to solve for trust and to create a system that is completely safe and secure from various harms

Cryptographic Hash Functions :

- Conversion of any input of any size converted into fixed size output is known as function of Cryptographic Hash Function
- Best method for hashing is Modulo Division Method (accordingto Wikipedia)

# Digital Signatures

Public Key Cryptography :

Cryptography

- Cryptography in early stages was study of encrypting message so that they could not be decrypted even if intercepted and it was used for important secrets.
  Symmetric-Key Cryptography :

- Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and reciever share the same key

Personal Computing

- Public Key was introduced to make the blockchain more secure rather than sharing keys directly.

- Public Key Cryptography is considered as Asymmetric Encryption in that only one party has access to private key.

- And only the person having key can decrypt the message sent to him!

RSA and ECDSA Algorithms

- Both Algorithms used for public key cryptography

- RSA algorithm is very difficult to be decrypted and is still an unsolved mystery in Computer Science.

- ECDSA algorithm uses Elliptic Curves and provide same level of security as other public key algorithms with smaller key sizes

- It is the Digital Signing Algorithm used by Bitcoin, specially the `secp256k1` curve

- `secp256k1` is used in Bitcoins public-key crpytography. `secp256k1` was constructed in a special non-random way which allows for especially efficient computation. As a result, it is often more than 30% faster than other curves if the implementation is sufficiently optimized.

- _Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange_ is used to get that Secret Key
